<h1>!Introduction To Black Holes</h1>
    
    <p>You can find black holes in any point of space. Whenever stars go super Nova they create black holes.Today I will give you an introduction to black holes.  </p>
    
    <h2>What is a black hole?</h2>
    <p>A black hole is completely dark. It has a strong gravitational pull that can suffocate anything in its path. They have the ability to alter the structure of any living entity. They have the ability to suck things that are almost as big as themselves. When you travel into a black hole, you will be stretched, which is known as spaghettification. A black hole is a collapsing star capable of absorbing light! A supernova occurs when a star bursts. An event horizon is a boundary that separates a black hole from the rest of the universe. It prevents any events from occuring.</p>
    
    <h2>Types of blackholes</h2>
    <p>Stellar, supermassive, and intermediate black holes are the three types of black holes. Each black hole has its own mass, similar to that of a sun. Stellar-mass black holes have masses ranging from 10 to 100 sun masses, supermassive black holes have sizes ranging from millions to billions of solar masses, and intermediate black holes have values ranging from a few hundred to thousands of solar masses.</p>
    
    <h2>Features of a blackhole</h2>
    <p>One of the characteristics of black holes is their enormous gravity, which is comparable to that of the sun! It also has a lot of bulk. You can't see black holes since they are absolutely black. Anything might be sucked into black holes.</p>
    
    <p>And thats an introcuction to black holes. If you are interested in black holes you can study it.</p>
